# SynergyKM: The Missing GUI for Synergy #


## Description ##

From the Synergy ReadMe: 

"Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its
own display, without special hardware."

Synergy is a great tool, but it's missing a GUI that would make it
act like a real Mac application. We started SynergyKM to fill that
void. SynergyKM is a complete package; it includes a preference
pane and menubar item, along with a full copy of Synergy.


## Features ##

- Configuring Synergy client or server in a GUI
- Auto starting Synergy on login
- Handling multiple users and reconnecting after sleeps
- Handling multiple Synergy configurations/Locations (like Mac OS X's Network Locations)
- Automatic detection of locations using Bonjour networking (only works with Mac clients & servers for now)
- Menubar item with the Synergy status & locations for quick access


## Release Notes (for current version) ##
